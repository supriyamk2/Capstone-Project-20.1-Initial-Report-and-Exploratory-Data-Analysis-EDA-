# Capstone-Project-20.1-Initial-Report-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-


#### Executive summary
- Explored and analysed heart attack prediction dataset using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn
- Predicted heart attack risk using logistic regression and tree based models.


#### Rationale
Predicting heart attack before it occurs is one of the important topic in medical industry.
The machine learning algorithms help doctors find the factors that cause heart attacks based on data.

#### Research Question
Heart attack analysis and prediction before it happens.

#### Methodology
EDA, Classification methods such as Logistic regression, and other tree based models.

#### Results
83% accuracy with logistic regression model
80% accuracy with Random forest model.
